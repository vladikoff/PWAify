## Usage

> Node 4+ required.

Install:

```
npm install -g pwaify
```

## Run against your PWA app

```
pwaify https://airhorner.com
pwaify https://voice-memos.appspot.com/ --platforms=darwin --icon chrome-touch-icon-384x384.icns
```

(Might require `sudo` at the moment if you get `pref.json` error).

Open the app on your platform, test and send it to your friends!

More apps at [pwa.rocks](https://pwa.rocks/). At this moment you need to convert your icons for your platform, using something like [iconverticons.com/online/](https://iconverticons.com/online/).
